# 📘 February: Master a Core Language

##  Repository Description
A personal February challenge focused on mastering a core programming language, improving code quality, and practicing real-world debugging and optimization.

---

## 🎯 Monthly Focus
This month, I am focusing on **depth over breadth**. Instead of jumping between tools or languages, I’m committing to mastering **one core programming language** and sharpening how I write, read, debug, and optimize code.

My goal is to become fluent enough to confidently work with complex codebases and improve them effectively.

## 🔍 Deep Dive: My Learning Path

### Python (Advanced Track)
Since I’m already comfortable with Python, I’m diving deeper into advanced concepts:
- Decorators
- Generators and iterators
- Context managers
- Asynchronous programming (`async` / `await`)
- Debugging, profiling, and performance optimization

*(If using Java or C++, this month would focus on deep OOP principles and clean class design.)*
